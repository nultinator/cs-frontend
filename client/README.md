# Chosen Sanctuary NFT Marketplace

This code was originally forked from the Tutorial [Build your own NFT Marketplace from Scratch](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/) built by [alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com)

To set up the repository and run the marketplace locally, run the below
```bash
git clone https://username:password@github.com/cs-marketplace.git
cd cs-marketplace
npm install
```

Deploy the contract (if you wish to deploy to a different chain, please update hardhat.config.js):
```bash
npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/deploy.js
```

Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
